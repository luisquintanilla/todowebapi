// Assume that a docker container is running for Redis, running and accessible at host "redis" and port 6379 as specified in the docker-compose.yml file. Make use of the Redis container for persisting data from the TODO app.    
// Use static files in the.well - known directory to the path /.well-known, which should at minimum contain ai-plugin.json that serves (as JSON).// Use the ai-plugin.json file to serve the plugin.json file from the ChatAPI project.
// Write a simple TODO app using Minimal ASP.NET, that lets the user add TODOs, list their TODOs, list specific TODOs, and delete TODOs, ensuring that the app stores Id for each todo item.
